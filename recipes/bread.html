    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The classic white loaf made a comeback in lockdown when everyone was stuck inside and suddenly had time, once again, to make bread the old fashioned way. This recipe was based off a BBC good food recipe for <a href="https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/classic-white-loaf">Classic white loaf</a>.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>500g strong white flour, plus extra for dusting</li>
        <li>7g sachet fast-action dried yeast</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>up to 350ml lukewarm water</li>
        <li>a little sunflower oil, for greasing</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <h4>STEP 1</h4>
    <p>Make the dough by tipping the flour, yeast and salt into a large bowl and making a well in the middle. Pour in most of the water and use your fingers or a wooden spoon to mix the flour and water together until combined to a slightly wet, pillowy, workable dough - add a splash more water if necessary. Tip the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead for at least 10 mins until smooth and elastic. This can also be done in a tabletop mixer with a dough hook. Place the dough in a clean oiled bowl, cover with cling film and leave to rise until doubled in size.</p>
    <h4>STEP 2</h4>
    <p>Heat oven to 220C/fan 200C/gas 7. Knock back the dough by tipping it back onto a floured surface and pushing the air out. Mould the dough into a rugby ball shape that will fit a 900g loaf tin and place in the tin. Cover with a clean tea towel and leave to prove for 30 mins. Dust the top of the loaf with a little more flour and slash the top with a sharp knife if you want. Bake the bread for 15 mins, then reduce the heat to 190C/fan 170C/gas 5 and continue to bake for 30 mins until the loaf sounds hollow when removed from the tin and tapped on the base. Leave the bread on a wire rack to cool completely. The loaf will stay fresh in an airtight container for 3 days or can be frozen for 1 month.</p>
